# parzels pentest pack [3xp]
A collection of hacking and pentest tools I use that are usually not available within a package manager. This collection is a work in progress and will grow the next months.

All tools will be included as submodules from their regarding git so that it is easy to keep them up to date.

```
# Clone
$ git clone https://github.com/parzel/3xp

# Setup
$ git submodule update --init --recursive

# Update 
$ git submodule update --recursive --remote
